# Input
# This endpoint should expect a JSON object in the body of the request with the following structure:
# {
#     "title": "<title of the new post>",
#     "content": "<content of the new post>"
# }
# Both title and content are required. If the client does not provide these, your endpoint should return an appropriate error response. Go to “Error Handling” section for more information.
# Notice that you don’t need to send the ID, since your backend will generate a new ID automatically. Also, remember that the ID must be an integer for the frontend to work correctly.
# Output
# If the client provides valid input, your endpoint should add the new post to the list of posts and return a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "id": "<id of the new post>",
    "title": "<title of the new post>",
    "content": "<content of the new post>"
# }
# The id should be a new unique identifier for this post. The status code of the response should be 201 Created.
# 💡 Note: your code needs to generate this unique identifier.

#  Testing Your API
# After you’ve implemented the “add” endpoint, it’s time to test it with Postman.
# Start your Flask app if it’s not already running.
# Open Postman and create a new POST request to http://localhost:5002/api/posts.
# In the “Body” tab, select “raw” and then “JSON” from the dropdown menu.
# Enter a JSON object with ‘title’ and ‘content’ for your new post.
# Send the request.

# You should receive a response with status code 201 and the body containing the new post with a unique id. If you send a GET request to /api/posts, you should see your new post in the list of posts.

# Try also sending a POST request without title or content, or without both, and check if your endpoint returns the correct error responses.

# If everything is working as expected, congratulations! 🎉 You’ve successfully implemented the “add” operation. In the next step, you’ll implement the “delete” operation. But before moving on, make sure your “add” operation is working correctly!
